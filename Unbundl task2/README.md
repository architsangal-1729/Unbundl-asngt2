 Here's a detailed explanation of my approach:

HTML:

Semantics: I used semantic HTML tags to enhance the structure and meaning of the content. For instance, the <header> tag represents the introductory content at the top of the page, while <nav> is used for the navigation bar.

Sections: I organized the content into sections such as the "customizer," "cart-container," and "footer" to provide clarity and separation of concerns.

IDs and Classes: I used IDs (#customizer, #cart-container) and classes to uniquely identify and style specific elements, enhancing the maintainability of the code.


CSS:

Responsive Design: The CSS includes styles for creating a responsive and visually appealing user interface. The use of percentage widths and media queries ensures that the layout adapts to different screen sizes.

Color Scheme: I chose a color scheme that complements the chocolate theme, with brown tones for the header and footer, and contrasting colors for the navigation bar and customizer.

Flexbox: To achieve a centered and flexible layout for the navigation bar and header content, I utilized Flexbox properties. This allows for easy alignment and responsiveness.


JavaScript:

Dynamic Content: JavaScript is used to handle dynamic content updates, such as adding items to the cart and updating the total price. The script provides a seamless and interactive experience for users.

Array Manipulation: An array (selectedChocolates) is used to store selected items in the cart, and JavaScript functions manipulate this array to manage quantities and update the display.

Event Listeners: I utilized event listeners to trigger actions when the user interacts with the page, such as clicking the "Add to Cart" button.


Overall Approach:

User-Centric Design: The user interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to easily customize their chocolate bundles and view their selections in the cart.

Accessibility: Semantic HTML and thoughtful CSS styling contribute to the accessibility of the application, ensuring that it is usable by a diverse audience.

Maintainability: The use of IDs, classes, and organized HTML structure enhances the maintainability of the code. The JavaScript functions are modular and focused on specific tasks, making the codebase more readable and maintainable.

No External Frameworks: Considering the relatively simple nature of the project, I opted not to use external frameworks or libraries. This decision reduces overhead and keeps the codebase lightweight.


Presentation Considerations:

Demo Flow: During the presentation, I would start by demonstrating the basic functionality of the Chocolate Bundle Customizer, showcasing how users can select chocolates, add them to the cart, and see the total price update dynamically.

Code Highlights: I would emphasize key sections of the code, such as the array manipulation in JavaScript, the use of Flexbox for layout, and the semantic HTML structure.

Responsive Design: I would showcase the responsiveness of the design, possibly by adjusting the browser window size during the demo to demonstrate how the layout adapts.
